		<h2>Work Experience</h2><hr>
			<h3>Product Manager (Defy Appliances) March 2021 - Current</h3>
				<p>
				The function of a product manager at Defy is to identify the needs of the customer and 
				the business objective that a product or feature will fulfill. The product manager then 
				articulates what success looks like for a product and brings a team together to turn that 
				vision into a reality. This role has taught me so many valuable skills. It has significantly 
				improved my communication skills. Since I link all the different departments, I must take the 
				information from e.g., engineering to sales and explain it in terms which make sense to them. 
				I have learnt how to work under pressure. My category, refrigeration is worth just under 
				2-billion-rand per year. There are always so many projects running concurrently, so I must be 
				organized to be able to juggle all these projects depending on their priority. When any of the 
				teams are stuck, I must make a decision on how we move forward. I must plan with all the different 
				departments on launch dates, get everyone aligned so that the product launch can be a success. 
				My accomplishments include:
				<ul>
					<li>Launched five new innovative fridge models. From launch the SKUs have generated just over 
					50-million-rand revenue.<li>
					<li>Launched a solar Hybrid Fridge range, the first of its kind in South Africa, which uplifts 
					Defy in terms of innovation in the consumers’ eyes.<li>
					<li>Launched a new world class range of fridges under a new brand in South Africa (Beko).
				</ul>

			<h3>Maths Tutor (Self Employed) 2017 - 2020</h3>
				<p>
				As a university student I was looking to make a little extra cash. My main problem was I didn’t want 
				to miss lectures so tutoring for an established company part time was difficult. To solve this problem, 
				I decided to tutor privately. I put up an ad on a free site and if anyone was interested, they would 
				phone me to schedule a time where I would be free. I would then drive to the student’s location and tutor 
				for 2 or 3 hours. As school progressed balancing time for school and tutoring became a little more difficult, 
				so I decided to record maths videos which covered the whole grade 12 syllabus. This was a transfer of my 
				teaching knowledge from tutoring to video content. I then sold these videos (digital and physical copies) 
				to some of my students and other students who were interested. This solution allowed me to continue to make money, 
				but it also allowed me to teach and help a lot more children since I didn’t have to be there physically. 
				My accomplishments include:
				<ul>
					<li>Having all students, I tutored passing grade 12.
				</ul>

		<h2>Projects</h2><hr>
			<h3>Task Manager System</h3>
				<p>
				I created a Python system which can be used to manage tasks by a small company. There is admin atttributes and a regular
				user attributes. Both types of users have different permissions. Admin can register users while a regular user cannot.
				<br>You can have a look at it by clicking <a target = "_blank" href = "https://github.com/tinonyamz/task_manager"> Here</a>
				<p>
			<h3>Shoe Inventory System</h3>
				<p>
				I created a Python system which can be used to manage the inventory of shoes at a warehouse. The system allows you to 
				check what shoes are on the system and what their stock holding is. You can add a new shoe. It also allows you
				to top up stock. Another function is you can see what value of stock your warehouse is holding.

				<p>
			<h3>Project Management</h3>
				<p>
				I created a Java system which can be used for project management. This system is used to keep track of all the projects
				which are in progress or completed. It allows a user to be able to add new projects, edit current project details, edit 
				contractor and customer details. It can also help finalise a project, print a receipt if full payment hasn't been
				made. This project was done using textfiles as well as MySQL database.

			<h3>Sun Tracking Solar System</h3>
				<p>
				very interesting project as it was one, I choose myself. I pitched it to a supervisor, and he loved it. 
				The project combines hands on technical work with programming. The focus of the project was to find out 
				if a sun tracking solar system is more efficient than a fixed solar system. I used an Arduino board for 
				the brain of the whole system. The Arduino board read data from the two LDR sensors which I placed onto of 
				the system. With data read from the sensors, the program would decide whether to make the motor rotate 
				clockwise or anti-clockwise. If the number difference between the two sensors was very small, then the system 
				would be stationary. This position would have the solar panels facing the sun and getting the most sun. 
				I used an ESP so that I could read the data online to check if the system is more efficient or not. 
				I learnt how to design on fusion 360, and 3D print. The platform on which the solar panels lay were 3D printed. 
				With the measurements I did vs a fixed system the sun tracking solar system was more efficient than the 
				fixed system. This proved my initial theory that if the solar panels were placed in the most optimum positions 
				throughout the day, it would make the system more efficient.

			<h3>Smart Water Meter</h3>
				<p>
				In my 4th year first semester I worked on a smart water meter. The 
				function of the smart meter was to allow the user to have better control over their consumption habits. 
				Knowing how much water you use will help you realise where you are using too much. Having this information 
				allows you to be able to make informed decisions. I made the system using an ESP since I wanted to allow 
				for the user to be able to see their consumption numbers not just on the LCD but online as well. 
				I made use of a flow sensor to measure how much water has gone past. Using the code, I converted 
				the RPM value into a readable number in litres. I also showed the flow rate in litres. This project allowed 
				me to gain more technical hands-on experience with both coding and putting all the parts together. I was able 
				to use trial and error to ensure that my conversion was giving the correct litre output.
